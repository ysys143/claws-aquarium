"""daily_digest dataset — 30 realistic workday briefing tasks.

Each task provides a morning context (calendar, todos, messages, news interests)
and the agent must produce a prioritized daily digest.

Difficulty tiers:
- easy (10): simple day with 2-3 meetings, few messages, clear priorities
- medium (10): busy day with conflicting priorities, cross-team dependencies
- hard (10): crisis scenarios mixing urgent incidents with normal workload
