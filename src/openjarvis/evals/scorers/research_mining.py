The AI was asked to research a topic and provide key findings, supporting evidence, and a synthesis.

Expected key facts/topics that should be covered:
{key_facts}

Research question:
{question}

AI response:
{response}

Evaluate the response on these criteria:
1. Accuracy: Are the stated facts correct and not hallucinated?
2. Coverage: Does it address the key facts/topics listed above?
3. Depth: Does it go beyond surface-level observations?
4. Structure: Is it well-organized with clear findings and synthesis?
5. Relevance: Does it stay focused on the research question?

Your response MUST use exactly this format:
accuracy: <1-5>
coverage: <1-5>
depth: <1-5>
structure: <1-5>
relevance: <1-5>
reasoning: <brief explanation>
overall_correct: <yes or no>"""
