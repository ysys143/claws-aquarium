"""SWE-bench scorer — structural patch validation.

Full SWE-bench evaluation requires running tests inside the repository
environment.  This scorer performs lightweight structural checks on the
model output (e.g. whether it looks like a valid patch) and defers the
authoritative pass/fail to external test execution.
