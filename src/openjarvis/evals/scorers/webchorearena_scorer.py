"""Scorer for WebChoreArena web chore tasks.

Uses the environment-validated scoring pattern (same as WorkArenaScorer):
the ``WebChoreArenaTaskEnv`` runs the original WebArena evaluation harness
(StringEvaluator × URLEvaluator × HTMLContentEvaluator, multiplicative)
and populates ``record.metadata["is_resolved"]`` and ``record.metadata["reward"]``.
This scorer reads those fields.

The evaluation harness inside the task env faithfully mirrors the original:
- StringEvaluator: exact_match, must_include (with |OR| support), fuzzy_match
  (LLM-judged via GPT-4o), ua_match (unachievable task detection)
- URLEvaluator: checks browser's current page URL against reference URLs
- HTMLContentEvaluator: navigates to URLs, runs JS locators on DOM, checks
  element content against expected values
