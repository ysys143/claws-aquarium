_GRADER_TEMPLATE = """You are evaluating an AI system's answer against a reference answer.

Compare the predicted answer against the Ground Truth Answer and determine if the prediction is correct.

## Evaluation Guidelines

1. **Focus on semantic meaning**: Look for equivalent information - exact wording is not required.
2. **Assess factual accuracy**: Determine whether the essential facts from the Ground Truth are present in the answer.
3. **Ignore minor differences**: Capitalization, punctuation, formatting, and word order don't matter.
4. **Partial credit**: If the Ground Truth has multiple parts, all essential parts must be present for a correct rating.
5. **Additional information**: Extra correct information in the prediction is acceptable, but extra incorrect information is not.
6. **Numerical answers**: Should match exactly (accounting for different formats like $1,000 vs 1000).

## Question / Prompt
{question}

## Ground Truth Answer
{ground_truth}

## Predicted Answer
{predicted_answer}

Your response MUST use exactly this format:
extracted_final_answer: <the final answer extracted from the predicted answer, or 'None' if no answer is present>
reasoning: <brief explanation of why the extracted answer is or is not correct>
correct: <yes or no>"""
