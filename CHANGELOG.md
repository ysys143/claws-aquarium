## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Activity Console page with historical log browser and summary cards.
- Floating Live Stream widget -- global SSE-powered log viewer that persists across navigation. Three states: hidden, collapsed pill, expanded panel with play/pause, copy, and auto-scroll.
- Expandable log rows: click any row to see the raw JSON payload.
- Memory Guide tab: categorized best practices (Writing, Search, Maintenance) with DO/DON'T pills, responsive 2-column config visualizer grid.
- Cost Dashboard page with daily cost chart, per-job breakdown, model distribution, anomaly detection, week-over-week trends, and cache savings estimation.
- SSE parser library (`lib/sse.ts`) with `parseSSEBuffer()` and `parseSSELine()`.

### Fixed

- Memory browser file content not visible on desktop (sidebar missing `browser-sidebar` class, consumed full container width).
