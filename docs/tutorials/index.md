# Tutorials

Hands-on guides that walk through building real applications with OpenJarvis. Each tutorial includes a standalone script you can run immediately, a TOML recipe for configuration, and a detailed walkthrough of the concepts involved.

!!! note "Before you begin"
    All tutorials assume OpenJarvis is installed and an inference engine is running. If you have not completed setup yet, start with the [Quick Start guide](../getting-started/quickstart.md).

## What You Will Learn

Each tutorial demonstrates a different combination of OpenJarvis primitives working together:

| Tutorial | Agent | Key Primitives |
|---|---|---|
| Deep Research | `orchestrator` | Engine, Agents, Tools (web + memory), Recipes |
| Scheduled Ops | `orchestrator`, `native_react` | Agents, Tools, Scheduler |
| Messaging Hub | `orchestrator` | Agents, Tools (memory), Channels |
| Code Companion | `native_react` | Agents, Tools (git + file + shell) |

## Estimated Time

Each tutorial takes approximately 15-30 minutes to complete end-to-end, including setup and running the scripts. The TOML configuration sections and customization tips are optional reading for when you adapt the pattern to your own use case.
