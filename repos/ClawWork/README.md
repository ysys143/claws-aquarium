ClawPort is an open-source dashboard for managing, monitoring, and talking directly to your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) AI agents. It connects to your local OpenClaw gateway and gives you an org chart, direct agent chat with vision and voice, a kanban board, cron monitoring, cost tracking, an activity console with live log streaming, and a memory browser -- all in one place.

No separate AI API keys needed. Everything routes through your OpenClaw gateway.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install OpenClaw

ClawPort requires a running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) instance. If you don't have one yet:

```bash
# Install OpenClaw
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

# Run the onboarding wizard (sets up workspace, gateway, and daemon)
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

After onboarding, verify the gateway is running:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

You should see your gateway URL (`localhost:18789`) and auth token. See the [OpenClaw docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/getting-started) for more detail.

### 2. Install ClawPort

> **Note:** The npm package is `clawport-ui`. The CLI command is `clawport`.
> Do not install the unrelated `clawport` package.

```bash
npm install -g clawport-ui
```

### 3. Connect and Launch

```bash
# Auto-detect your OpenClaw config and write .env.local
clawport setup

# Start the dashboard
clawport dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The onboarding wizard walks you through naming your portal, picking a theme, and setting up your operator identity.

<details>
<summary><strong>Install from source instead</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnRiceML/clawport-ui.git
cd clawport-ui
npm install
npm run setup
npm run dev
```

</details>

## How It Works

ClawPort reads your OpenClaw workspace to discover agents, then connects to the gateway for all AI operations:

```
Browser  -->  ClawPort (Next.js)  -->  OpenClaw Gateway (localhost:18789)  -->  Claude
                  |                          |
                  |                     Text: /v1/chat/completions (streaming SSE)
                  |                     Vision: openclaw gateway call chat.send (CLI)
                  |                     Audio: /v1/audio/transcriptions (Whisper)
                  |
             Reads from:
               $WORKSPACE_PATH/agents/    (agent SOUL.md files)
               $WORKSPACE_PATH/memory/    (team memory)
               openclaw cron list         (scheduled jobs)
```

All AI calls -- chat, vision, TTS, transcription -- route through the gateway. One token, no separate API keys.

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | How to find it |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `WORKSPACE_PATH` | Path to your OpenClaw workspace | Default: `~/.openclaw/workspace` |
| `OPENCLAW_BIN` | Path to the `openclaw` binary | Run `which openclaw` |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Gateway auth token | Run `openclaw gateway status` |

### Optional

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | ElevenLabs API key for voice indicators on agent profiles |

Running `clawport setup` auto-detects all required values and writes `.env.local`. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for manual configuration, agent customization, and troubleshooting.

---

## Agent Discovery

ClawPort automatically discovers agents from your OpenClaw workspace. No configuration file needed.

**What it scans:**
- `$WORKSPACE_PATH/SOUL.md` -- root orchestrator
- `$WORKSPACE_PATH/IDENTITY.md` -- root agent name and emoji
- `agents/<name>/SOUL.md` -- top-level agents
- `agents/<name>/sub-agents/*.md` -- flat sub-agent files
- `agents/<name>/members/*.md` -- team member files
- `agents/<name>/<subdir>/SOUL.md` -- nested subdirectory agents

**What it ignores:**
- Directories without `SOUL.md` (e.g., `briefs/`, data files)
- Non-`.md` files in `sub-agents/` and `members/`

For full control over names, colors, hierarchy, and tools, create `$WORKSPACE_PATH/clawport/agents.json`. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the schema and examples.
