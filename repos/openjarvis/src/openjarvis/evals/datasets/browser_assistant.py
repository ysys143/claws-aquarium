"""browser_assistant dataset — 30 web research tasks.

Each task provides a research question with verifiable facts tagged as
`exact` (string/number match) or `semantic` (LLM judge needed).

Difficulty tiers:
- easy (10): single factual lookup
- medium (10): comparison or multi-fact research
- hard (10): complex synthesis requiring multiple sources
