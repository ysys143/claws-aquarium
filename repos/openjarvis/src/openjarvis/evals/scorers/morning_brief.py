_JUDGE_PROMPT = """You are evaluating an AI-generated morning briefing.

The AI was given calendar events, todos, news topics, and pending messages, and asked to produce a prioritized morning brief.

Key priorities that should be highlighted:
{key_priorities}

Original user context (summary):
{problem_excerpt}

AI-generated briefing:
{response}

Evaluate the briefing on these criteria:
1. Completeness: Does it cover calendar, todos, messages, and news?
2. Prioritization: Are the most urgent/important items highlighted first?
3. Conciseness: Is it well-organized and scannable, not too verbose?
4. Actionability: Does it clearly indicate what needs attention today?
5. Key priorities: Does it mention the key priorities listed above?

Your response MUST use exactly this format:
completeness: <1-5>
prioritization: <1-5>
conciseness: <1-5>
actionability: <1-5>
key_priorities_covered: <yes or partial or no>
reasoning: <brief explanation>
overall_correct: <yes or no>"""
