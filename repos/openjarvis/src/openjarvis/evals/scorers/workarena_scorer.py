"""Scorer for WorkArena++ enterprise workflow tasks.

Uses the native ``task.validate()`` reward from BrowserGym, which checks
the actual state of the ServiceNow instance via Playwright.  No LLM
judging — scoring is fully deterministic based on environment validation.

This mirrors the TerminalBenchNativeScorer pattern: the ``WorkArenaTaskEnv``
populates ``record.metadata["is_resolved"]`` and ``record.metadata["reward"]``
after calling ``task.validate()``, and this scorer reads those fields.
