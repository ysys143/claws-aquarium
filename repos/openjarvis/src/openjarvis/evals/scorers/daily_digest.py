"""daily_digest scorer — phrase match, ordering, and checklist evaluation.

Tier 1 (phrase match): Check each must-mention item against model output.
Tier 1 (ordering): Check that top-priority items appear in first half of response.
Tier 2 (checklist): Binary checklist for structure, accuracy, and actionability.

Score: (items_mentioned/total) * 0.5 + ordering_score * 0.3 + checklist * 0.2
