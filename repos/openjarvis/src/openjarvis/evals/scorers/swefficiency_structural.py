"""SWEfficiency scorer — structural patch validation.

Full SWEfficiency evaluation requires running performance benchmarks
inside the repository environment.  This scorer performs lightweight
structural checks on the model output (e.g. whether it looks like a
valid patch) and defers the authoritative pass/fail to external
benchmark execution.
